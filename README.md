# write_by_numbers
A tool to help write long form pieces. This helps to ensure ideas are introduced before they are used, that order of ideas is maintained and allows for tackling smaller bite size pieces of work. Reducing a cognitive load for task switching, and reducing the time requirements to make contributions. Each node has meta, and sentence data, which allows for building networks - and automatically highlighting missing pieces. Enter a node, set up stream requirements (like software might have) and forget about those. They can be filled in later. Continue writing where you are.  Then at compile time, upstream sentences will fall into place. No manual moving of content is (possibly allowed) encouraged.
