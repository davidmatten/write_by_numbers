# write_by_numbers
A tool to help write long form pieces. This helps to ensure ideas are introduced before they are used, that order of ideas is maintained and allows for tackling smaller bite size pieces of work. Reducing a cognitive load for task switching, and reducing the time requirements to make contributions. Each node has meta, and sentence data, which allows for building networks - and automatically highlighting missing pieces. Enter a node, set up stream requirements (like software might have) and forget about those. They can be filled in later. Continue writing where you are.  Then at compile time, upstream sentences will fall into place. No manual moving of content is (possibly allowed) encouraged.


Meta can include:
- what a node should cover / contain.
- points
- to 
- cover
(eg: bnAbs, V3 targetting)

Include things like: relies on: X, Y, and Z. (These can be tags and searchable with autocomplete).

each node fits into a left to right flow - multi-nodes flowing into multi-nodes. (This could get fairly complex to organize an explicit order).
[Previous] and [Next] type buttons in a viewer.


The node will contain actual sentences:
"The bnAbs are blaa blaa. They are a type of blaaa. and extend the idea by blaaa."


Option extra data for a node: 
- refs.
